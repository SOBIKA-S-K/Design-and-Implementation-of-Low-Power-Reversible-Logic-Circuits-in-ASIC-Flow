# Design-and-Implementation-of-Low-Power-Reversible-Logic-Circuits-in-ASIC-Flow
 The RTL design was implemented using Verilog HDL, synthesized with Cadence Genus, and physical design completed using Cadence Innovus. Emphasis was placed on optimizing power, area, and timing parameters during the ASIC design flow.
