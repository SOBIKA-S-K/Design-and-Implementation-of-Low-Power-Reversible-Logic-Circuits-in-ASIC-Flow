# Design and Simulation of 4-Bit Carry Save Adder Using Reversible Logic Gates in Cadence
🔧 Project: Reversible Logic-Based Low Power Adder in Cadence
📁 Tools Used: Verilog HDL, Cadence Genus, Innovus, Incisive
⚙️ Technology: 180nm ASIC Flow

☞ Overview:
This project explores the design and physical implementation of a carry-save adder using reversible logic gates for potential application in low-power and quantum-compatible systems. The project compares traditional logic vs. reversible logic in terms of power, area, and timing, using a full RTL-to-GDSII ASIC flow.

☞ Key Features:

❉ Developed both standard and reversible CSA designs in Verilog HDL.

❉ Used Cadence Genus for synthesis and timing-driven optimization.

❉ Performed floorplanning, placement, power routing, and layout using Cadence Innovus.

❉ Verified performance metrics including delay, power, and area post-layout.

❉ Analyzed results to show reversible logic’s feasibility despite increased area/power cost.

☞ Results:

≽ Traditional CSA: Lower area (152.094 units) and power (0.0266 mW).

≽ Reversible CSA: Increased area (167.275 units) and power (0.0364 mW), but with potential long-term benefits for reversible and quantum circuits.
